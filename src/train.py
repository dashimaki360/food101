# Inputs
# ------
#
# Here are all of the parameters to change for the run. We will use the
# *hymenoptera_data* dataset which can be downloaded
# `here <https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/hymenoptera_data.zip>`__.
# This dataset contains two classes, **bees** and **ants**, and is
# structured such that we can use the
# `ImageFolder <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder>`__
# dataset, rather than writing our own custom dataset. Download the data
# and set the ``data_dir`` input to the root directory of the dataset. The
# ``model_name`` input is the name of the model you wish to use and must
# be selected from this list:
#
# ::
#
#    [resnet, alexnet, vgg, squeezenet, densenet, inception]
#
# The other inputs are as follows: ``num_classes`` is the number of
# classes in the dataset, ``batch_size`` is the batch size used for
# training and may be adjusted according to the capability of your
# machine, ``num_epochs`` is the number of training epochs we want to run,
# and ``feature_extract`` is a boolean that defines if we are finetuning
# or feature extracting. If ``feature_extract = False``, the model is
# finetuned and all model parameters are updated. If
# ``feature_extract = True``, only the last layer parameters are updated,
# the others remain fixed.
#

#   to the ImageFolder structure

######################################################################
# Create the Optimizer
# --------------------
#
# Now that the model structure is correct, the final step for finetuning
# and feature extracting is to create an optimizer that only updates the
# desired parameters. Recall that after loading the pretrained model, but
# before reshaping, if ``feature_extract=True`` we manually set all of the
# parameter’s ``.requires_grad`` attributes to False. Then the
# reinitialized layer’s parameters have ``.requires_grad=True`` by
# default. So now we know that *all parameters that have
# .requires_grad=True should be optimized.* Next, we make a list of such
# parameters and input this list to the SGD algorithm constructor.
#
# To verify this, check out the printed parameters to learn. When
# finetuning, this list should be long and include all of the model
# parameters. However, when feature extracting this list should be short
# and only include the weights and biases of the reshaped layers.
#

# Send the model to GPU
model_ft = model_ft.to(device)

# Gather the parameters to be optimized/updated in this run. If we are
#  finetuning we will be updating all parameters. However, if we are
#  doing feature extract method, we will only update the parameters
#  that we have just initialized, i.e. the parameters with requires_grad
#  is True.
params_to_update = model_ft.parameters()
print("Params to learn:")

    params_to_update = []
    for name, param in model_ft.named_parameters():
        if param.requires_grad == True:
            params_to_update.append(param)
            print("\t", name)
else:
    for name, param in model_ft.named_parameters():
        if param.requires_grad == True:

# Observe that all parameters are being optimized
optimizer_ft = optim.SGD(params_to_update, lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

######################################################################
# Run Training and Validation Step
# --------------------------------
#
# Finally, the last step is to setup the loss for the model, then run the
# training and validation function for the set number of epochs. Notice,
# depending on the number of epochs this step may take a while on a CPU.
# Also, the default learning rate is not optimal for all of the models, so
# to achieve maximum accuracy it would be necessary to tune for each model
# separately.

# Comparison with Model Trained from Scratch
# ------------------------------------------
#
# Just for fun, lets see how the model learns if we do not use transfer
# learning. The performance of finetuning vs. feature extracting depends
# largely on the dataset but in general both transfer learning methods
# produce favorable results in terms of training time and overall accuracy
# versus a model trained from scratch.
